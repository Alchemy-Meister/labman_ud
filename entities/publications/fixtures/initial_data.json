            "abstract": "Smartphones have become everyday objects for many children. They learn how to count, spell or paint by swiping their fingers on a screen, using some of the thousands of applications specially designed for them. However, real world interactions also need other kind of skills for physical object manipulation,  often developed through traditional toys. In this paper we present 3DU Blocks, a proposal to take advantage of both approaches, combining traditional building blocks with the features provided by mobile devices to create new gaming experiences.\r\nUt erat nulla, faucibus ut adipiscing quis, aliquet eu tortor.

            "abstract": "Application of traditional service discovery solutions to mobile ad-hoc networks is a challenging task due to their intrinsic dynamic nature and the absence of any central information manager. However, service discovery is a critical aspect of service oriented technologies, e.g. remote service execution or, particularly service composition. We propose a solution for service discovery in mobile ad-hoc networks which is based on the dissemination of information about services' parameters instead of service unique identi\fers. Disseminated information is subsequently used during service search in order to reduce the number of propagated messages. In our solution, performed searches are maintained in the network until they are explicitly cancelled by source nodes. We also state that the usage of a shared taxonomy of parameter types reduces the number of propagated messages during dissemination and search. The proposed protocol has been fully implemented and tested using a network simulator.",
